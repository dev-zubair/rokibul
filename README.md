# Project - COLNAGO BIKE

Description : As for 60 years now, Ernesto enters his factory every morning and tirelessly takes care of every detail, gives birth to new ideas, looks beyond the borders. It makes plans for the future.

The year of the return of the big brands of bicycles on the jerseys of the runners: a concrete help of the builders to a sport in crisis. Naturally, Colnago is also on the front line with the Colnago CSF team. “If we do not believe in what we do, how could others invest in cycling?”.
